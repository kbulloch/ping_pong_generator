# Ping Pong Generator

#####By Kyle Bulloch and Kyle Giard-Chase

-----

#####Description
This app counts out a list of numbers up to the user's defined maximum.  Multiples of 3 are replaced by the word "ping", multiples of 5 are replaced by the word "pong" and multiples of 15 are replaced by "ping pong".  This app was built for Epicodus as an exercise in PHP, Silex and Twig.
#####Setup

Pre-requisites: Must have PHP installed.

These commands are for the user that chooses a Mac.  In your terminal, do:

Clone this repo
```
cd ShoeStores/web

php -S localhost:8000
```
You can now point your browser to localhost:8000 to ping and pong!
